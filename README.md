[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

**Objective**: Developed a machine learning system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, focusing on precise fraud identification with minimised false positives.

**Approach**: Conducted data exploration to handle class imbalance, implementing both supervised (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) and unsupervised (Isolation Forest) models. Leveraging predictive analytics to enhance fraud detection through learning models and utilised SMOTE to improve performance on minority classes.

**Key Results**: 
- Achieved 96.67% precision and 88.78% recall with an ROC-AUC of 98.32% using XGBoost, effectively balancing fraud detection accuracy with a low rate of false positives.

- Established a baseline with Logistic Regression, achieving 92.89% accuracy and 96.67% recall.
